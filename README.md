## HiBrain Framework

HiBrain is a hierarchical prototype-based multimodal brain graph learning framework for stage-aware neurodegenerative disease analysis. It models functional (fMRI) and structural (DTI) brain connectivity separately and progressively abstracts information from **node-level**, **graph-level**, and **class-level** representations.

The framework enables accurate multi-stage disease classification while providing interpretable, stage-specific brain network biomarkers through learned prototypes.
